This code is a method of encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows you to take a plaintext message and encrypt it using a key, producing a ciphertext output. This encryption can protect your sensitive data from being read by unauthorized parties. The decryption function takes the ciphertext and key, and returns the original plaintext message. Additionally, it measures the time required for both encryption and decryption, which could be useful for performance analysis.
