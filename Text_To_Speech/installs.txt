This script creates a window with a text entry field and a button labeled "Speak". When the button is clicked, the text entered in the field is passed to gTTS and the speech is saved to an mp3 file and played using the mpg321 player.

Please note that you will have to have gTTS and mpg321 installed in your system to run this script.
You can install them by running pip install gTTS and sudo apt-get install mpg321 respectively.
